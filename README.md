Here is a website for labrador breeders. App is written using React combines with Express.js server. Owner of website is able to update the content using Google Sheets. 

Website consists of several section: "Home Page", "About us", "Our dogs', "Puppies", "'Gallery" and "Contact".

App uses react-router-dom to navigate between components. 

Website is entirely responsive, that looks good on every screen. 

I've used useState to manage states, useContext to avoid prop drilling. Data are fetched from external source to in App.js and passed to: Feed.jsx, Litters.jsx and DogShows.jsx components.

It would be a pleasure if you will visit my website. Link below:
